# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a VPN IPsec Client application for Linux that provides a GUI interface with Deepin integration, allowing users to manage IPsec VPN connections with a toggle switch showing connection status, and implements a single-file logging system that saves logs to `~/vpnlogs/vpn_ipsec_client.log` with only one timestamp per log entry.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: PySide6 for GUI, Python 3.6+, Qt with Deepin integration
- **Architecture**: Separated IPsec management logic into IPsecManager class, main application in MainWindow class
- **UI Framework**: PySide6 with system theme detection, Fusion style for Deepin compatibility
- **Configuration Files**: Reads from `/etc/ipsec.conf` and `/etc/ipsec.d/*.conf` for IPsec connections
- **Logging**: Single log file at `~/vpnlogs/vpn_ipsec_client.log` with timestamps only when needed
- **IPsec Commands**: Uses `sudo ipsec up/down/status` commands for connection management
- **Toggle Switch**: Green for ON (Connected), Red for OFF (Disconnected) with CSS styling
- **Platform Specific**: Uses 'xcb' platform plugin for Deepin compatibility
- **Enhanced UI**: Connection selector, detailed connection information (auth type, protocols, remote subnet), expandable UI with more details

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Created initial application with toggle switch functionality
- [DONE] Implemented Deepin integration with system theme detection
- [DONE] Integrated direct read of IPsec configuration files and connection management
- [DONE] Separated responsibilities into IPsecManager class and main application class
- [DONE] Added constants for configuration, styling and connection states
- [DONE] Removed non-functional status bar from footer
- [DONE] Changed logging from multiple files to single file system in `~/vpnlogs/vpn_ipsec_client.log`
- [DONE] Fixed timestamp duplication issue by updating `add_status_message` function to not add timestamps and letting the logger handle it
- [DONE] Created vpnlogs directory to organize logs

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Complete the VPN IPsec Client with toggle switch and status display  
- [DONE] Implement proper IPsec configuration reading and management
- [DONE] Add single-file logging system that saves to `~/vpnlogs/vpn_ipsec_client.log`
- [DONE] Remove duplicate timestamps in log entries
- [DONE] Ensure proper Deepin integration and system theme compatibility
- [DONE] Finalize UI/UX improvements
- [DONE] Add additional IPsec configuration options
- [DONE] Complete final testing and documentation
