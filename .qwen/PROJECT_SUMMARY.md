# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a VPN IPsec Client application for Linux that provides a GUI interface with Deepin integration, allowing users to manage IPsec VPN connections with a toggle switch showing connection status, and implements logging functionality that only saves logs to file when the connection status is ON, while reducing visual log output in the interface.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: PySide6 for GUI, Python 3.6+, Qt with Deepin integration
- **Architecture**: Separated IPsec management logic into IPsecManager class, main application in VPNIPSecClientApp class
- **UI Framework**: PySide6 with system theme detection, Fusion style for Deepin compatibility
- **Configuration Files**: Reads from `/etc/ipsec.conf` and `/etc/ipsec.d/*.conf` for IPsec connections
- **Logging**: Logs saved to `~/.vpn_ipsec_logs/` only when connection is ON, interface shows reduced log output
- **IPsec Commands**: Uses `sudo ipsec up/down/status` commands for connection management
- **Toggle Switch**: Green for ON (Connected), Red for OFF (Disconnected) with CSS styling
- **Platform Specific**: Uses 'xcb' platform plugin for Deepin compatibility

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Created initial Tkinter application and migrated to PyQt5, then to PySide6
- [DONE] Implemented Deepin integration with system theme detection
- [DONE] Added toggle switch functionality with proper ON/OFF styling
- [DONE] Integrated direct read of IPsec configuration files and connection management
- [DONE] Separated responsibilities into IPsecManager class and main application class
- [DONE] Added constants for configuration, styling and connection states
- [DONE] Reduced interface logs and implemented file logging only when ON
- [DONE] Created organized code structure with proper typing and documentation
- [DONE] Fixed Qt platform plugin issues with dxcb/xcb compatibility

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Complete the VPN IPsec Client with toggle switch and status display
- [DONE] Implement proper IPsec configuration reading and management
- [DONE] Add logging functionality that only saves when ON
- [DONE] Reduce interface log output
- [DONE] Ensure proper Deepin integration and system theme compatibility
- [TODO] Finalize any remaining UI/UX improvements
- [TODO] Add additional IPsec configuration options if needed
- [TODO] Complete final testing and documentation
