# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a VPN IPsec Client for Linux with a smooth animated toggle switch for connection management, focusing on visual appeal and intuitive user experience.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: PySide6 for GUI, Python 3.6+, Linux with IPsec (StrongSwan/LibreSwan)
- **Architecture**: Clear separation between business logic (IPsecManager) and UI (VPNIPSecClientApp)
- **Toggle Component**: Enhanced ToggleSwitch with smooth animations, multiple connection states (CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, CONNECTING, DISCONNECTING)
- **Visual Elements**: Animated transitions, color changes, scaling effects, loading indicators, and visual feedback icons (check for connected, X for disconnected)
- **Animation System**: Uses QPropertyAnimation with QEasingCurve.OutCubic for smooth transitions and QTime for loading animations

## Recent Actions
- [COMPLETED] Created enhanced ToggleSwitch component with smooth animations
- [COMPLETED] Integrated toggle functionality with VPN connection/disconnection logic
- [COMPLETED] Configured color and size transition animations
- [COMPLETED] Added visual feedback with icons and loading indicators
- [IN PROGRESS] Testing functionality and animations

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Create the component ToggleSwitch with smooth animations
2. [DONE] Integrate the toggle with connection/disconnection VPN logic
3. [DONE] Configure transition animations for color and size
4. [DONE] Add visual feedback for connection states
5. [IN PROGRESS] Test functionality and animations (encountered import issue that was resolved)
6. [TODO] Finalize testing and run the complete application to verify toggle integration
